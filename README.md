# Matlab
Matlab code pertaining to projects, lab calculations, and homework problems

Senior Labs Fall
- consists of Mechanical Engineering Lab data, calculations, and plots done in Matlab

Vehicle Dynamics
- consists of functions and programs written for computer projects and homework
  - Computer Project 1 consists of modeling a vehicle with a trailer attached to it, switching lanes. Done by solving a system of 6 differential equations.
  - Computer Project 2 consists of solving for the angular velocity and acceleration of vehicles of different understeer/oversteer properties and at different speeds and to obtain their critical velocities.
  - Homework mostly from Vehicle Dynamics textbook by Haim Baruh
  
Finance
- simple program written to model Brownian Motion

Measurements Labs
- consists of Measurements Lab data, calculations, and plots done in Matlab

Baseball Project
- consists of functions and program to track the swing of a baseball player in a video. Not fully finished. A work in progress. Being used as research for Capstone Design project.

Measurements Homework
- consists of code used for homework from Theory and Design of Mechanical Measurements textbook by Richard S. Figliola and Donald E. Beasley
